## Making commits
- Use meaningful commit messages using Conventional Commit extension
- You can also type commit message on your own, but follow the previous commits approach

## Creating new branch
- When creating branches use next approaches:
  1. `<type-of-branch>/<short-description-in-2-to-5-words>`
  2. `fix/fixing-carousel-stuck-on-last-slide` 
  3. `feat/adding-responsiveness-to-marketplace-component`

## Creating PR
- When creating a PR make sure you are creating it against develop branch
- Leave a PR comment with detailed explanation on what was changed in this PR
- Before asking to make a review, make sure that it passes the CI/CD pipeline process
